	libsocket 1.6 released (minor release, no API change)

2004-11-14  Julien Lemoine <speedblue@happycoders.org>

	* New feature : return the content of buffer before 
	  end of connection (ClosedClosed exception), this allow
	  use of libsocket without any delimiter (get all content)

	* TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 are now working (with gnutls) for client 
	  and server (tested successfuly with telnet-ssl -z ssl)
	
2004-06-06  Julien Lemoine <speedblue@happycoders.org>

	* Fixed the bug includes and SENDTO_FLAGS confusion
	* Added support for TLS (with gnutls), for the moment there is no
	support for multi-threaded program. I wait for new gcrypt lib to
	enter in Debian.
	
2004-06-02  Samuel Pasquier <samuel@happycoders.org>

	Add the support for MacOSX
	Rename SENTO_FLAGS to SENDTO_FLAGS (there was a bug with the

2004-06-01  Julien Lemoine <speedblue@happycoders.org>

	Code cleanup (new file : socket.hxx. to avoid code duplication)

2004-05-31  Julien Lemoine <speedblue@happycoders.org>

	libsocket 1.4 released

	Add a option to allow empty lines in text protocols.
	This is usefull for some protocols (like IMAP).
	To keep backward compatibility, this option is disabled by
	default, you can enable it with allow_empty_lines() function.
	
2004-05-30  Julien Lemoine <speedblue@happycoders.org>

	libsocket 1.3 released

	Add a flag in sendto function to avoid SIGPIPE when remote
	connection is closed. This signal is very problematic with
	multi-threaded environment. Now a simple ConnectionClosed is
	throwed instead of SIGPIPE.
	Add TcpSocket::get_ip(TcpSocket*) method to get client ip
